# Bidding on Turtle Race Game using Python

This is a simple project for a Turtle Race Game, where players can place bids on which turtle they think will win the race. The game is built using Python and the Turtle Graphics module.

The game starts by prompting players to place their bids on one of the turtles. Once all the bids are in, the turtles start racing on the game board. The winner is determined by the turtle that crosses the finish line first.

The game provides a fun and interactive way to learn about Python's Turtle Graphics module and practice programming skills. It also teaches concepts related to bidding and probability, as players have to consider the odds of each turtle winning before placing their bids.

To play the game, simply run the Python script and follow the prompts to place your bid. The game board will be displayed on a new window and the turtles will start racing once all bids are in. The winner will be announced once the race is complete.

Overall, the Bidding on Turtle Race Game project is a great way to learn about Python programming and have fun at the same time. It provides a fun and interactive way to practice programming skills while also teaching concepts related to probability and bidding.
